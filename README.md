# Fund All
## A Charity Donation Project

### Overview:

This Java-based project, titled *Fund All*, is a charity/donation app. Users willing to donate will be able to 
choose a charity/cause of their choice and donate their desired amount of funds. Some of the features will include:

- **View a charity/cause**: Donors will be able to view a list of charities/causes and select one to donate to.
- **Start a charity/cause**: Users will be able to add their own charities/causes to the given list.
- **Favourite a charity/cause**: Donors that regularly donate to specific charities/causes will be able to add those to their list of favourites.

### My interest:

This project is important for me because, as an international student from a third world country, 
there is no such application in my country that allows users to choose a charity from a list and instead they must 
research on their own and send their donations via direct transfer. This app would allow a much more convenient 
and efficient pathway for donations, and perhaps the ease of it would lead to a higher number of donations!

### User Stories:
