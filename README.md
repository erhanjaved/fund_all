# Fund All
## A Charity Donation Project

### Overview:

This Java-based project, titled *Fund All*, is a charity/donation app. Users willing to donate will be able to 
choose a charity/cause of their choice and donate their desired amount of funds.

Some of the features will include:

- **View a charity/cause**: Donors will be able to view a list of charities/causes and select one to donate to!
- **Start a charity/cause**: Users will be able to add their own charities/causes to the given list!
- **View charities/causes that have reached their goals**: Users can view charities/causes that have reached their 
goals and opt to fund them as well!

### My interest:

This project is important for me because, as an international student from a third-world country, 
there is no such application in my country that allows users to choose a charity from a list, and instead they must 
research on their own and send their donations via direct transfer. This app would allow a much more convenient 
and efficient pathway for donations, and perhaps the ease of it would lead to a higher number of donations!

### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to add a charity/cause with a specific funding goal and also remove a charity/cause.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of charities/cause.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how many charities have reached their funding goals and view them.
- As a user, I want to be able to send funds to the charity/cause that I choose. 
- As a user, I want to be able to save my charities list to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my charities list from file (if I so choose)
